# PROJECT-Radiomics-Breast-Tumor
This project uses radiomics features from breast ultrasound images to classify tumors as benign or malignant. By extracting shape, intensity, and texture features and applying feature selection with deep learning, the system improves diagnostic accuracy, supporting early and reliable breast cancer detection.
